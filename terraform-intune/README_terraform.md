1Ô∏è‚É£ Terraform + Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

Provider: hashicorp/azuread

You can automate and manage almost all identity-related resources, for example:

- Users, groups, and group memberships
- Applications (App registrations, service principals, API permissions)
- Conditional Access policies (Baseline security policies)
- Directory roles and assignments 
- Custom security attributes 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Terraform + Microsoft Intune:

Provider: microsoftgraph

Terraform also supports Intune ‚Äî but not through the main Azure provider.

- Device configuration profiles (Windows, iOS, Android and linux)
- Compliance policies (Baseline policies also)
- Applications and app deployments
- Device categories
- Enrollment restrictions
- Autopilot profiles 
- Role assignments and scopes
- Intune policies and baselines

You must register an app in Entra ID that has Microsoft Graph API permissions (e.g., DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All) and then authenticate Terraform using its client ID/secret or certificate.

## Terraform usage with Intune and Entra ID. Below steps can be done using Terraform 

- Create a group in Entra ID using the azuread provider
- Create a Windows 11 compliance policy in Intune using the microsoftgraph provider
- Assign that policy to the created group
- Create an autopilot deployment profile 
- Assign it to a group also
